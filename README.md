Title: Irregular tensor singular value decomposition for single-cell multi-omics data clustering
Description: GSTRPCA is written in the MATLAB programming language. To use, please download the GSTRPCA folder and follow the instructions provided in the README.


To operate:
	* for the example of GSTRPCA:
		we have provided some pre-data for GSTRPCA, if you want to run GSTRPCA framwork, please run the script "GSTRPCA_Demo" directly.      

   *  Some of the data in the paper is included in the "Data" file.
